    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fry tofu in a coating of smoked paprika, garlic and seasoning to make these crispy tofu bites. Eat as a snack or as a starter or side dish in a veggie feast</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g block firm tofu</li>
        <li>3 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>½ tsp garlic granules</li>
        <li>½ tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>½ tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Drain the tofu, wrap in 4-5 sheets of kitchen paper, put on a plate and put something heavy over the top, 
            like a wooden chopping board, or a tray with a few tins on it. Leave for 20 mins to drain the excess moisture from the tofu.</li>
        <li>Mix the cornflour, garlic, paprika, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Unravel the tofu from the paper, cut in half through the centre, then cut into triangles, cubes or strips.</li>
        <li>Toss the tofu pieces in the spiced cornflour to coat all over. Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. 
            Fry the tofu for 2-4 mins on each side until golden, crunchy and browned at the edges. Smaller cubes will take 2 mins each side, larger triangles will take 4 mins. 
            Cook in batches if you need to, adding a little more oil if the pan gets dry.</li>
        <li>Drain the cooked tofu on kitchen paper and season with a pinch more salt before serving.</li>
    </ul>
